        Rules are everywhere and represent the most natural way for analysts and
        domain experts to formalize the business logic of their area of
        competence. A marketing manager can determine in this way the discount
        rules maximizing the income of a travel agency. A doctor can use them
        to diagnose a disease based on the presence or absence of certain
        symptoms. A labor consultant can regulate under which circumstances a
        worker can ask for retirement and with which compensation. A linguist
        can catalogue the words in a natural language sentence to produce a
        sentiment analysis tool. A bank accountant can establish which criteria
        an applicant should satisfy to get a mortgage. All these scenarios can
        be naturally translated into rules. The possibilities and range of
        applicability are basically infinite.

        Drools is a rule engine, the upstream project powering Red Hat Decision Manager, and a business rule management system that
        allows to define and efficiently evaluate and execute rules in a
        declarative way such as "when A then B". Using this sort of rules,
        instead of an imperative programming language, not only has the
        advantage of making the business logic much easier to understand and
        enabling business analysts to write, modify, verify and validate it. It
        even improves the maintainability of the knowledge base and makes it
        easier to deal with its evolving complexity: modifying a rule and
        determining the impact of these changes on the rest of the application
        is relatively straightforward. This approach also promotes modularity,
        since each rule models an isolated and small portion of the business
        logic and is not part of a monolithic program. Finally it provides a
        clear separation of the business logic from the rest of the
        infrastructural and architectural code of your application. This is
        relevant especially considering that typically they have a totally
        different lifecycle: the validity of a marketing rule can last even
        only a few hours while the architecture of your software application is
        designed to last for years.

        Drools is an open source DMN engine written in Javaâ„¢, providing full
        runtime support for DMN models at Conformance level 3, meaning 100% of
        the features in the Standard.
