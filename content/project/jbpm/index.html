        jBPM originates from BPM (Business Process Management) but it has evolved
        to enable users to pick their own path in business automation. It
        provides various capabilities that simplify and externalize business
        logic into reusable assets such as cases, processes, decision tables
        and more.

        jBPM is the upstream project powering Red Hat Process Automation Manager.
        A business process allows you to model your business goals by describing
        the steps that need to be executed to achieve that goal and the order,
        using a flow chart. This greatly improves the visibility and agility of
        your business logic, results in higher-level and domain-specific
        representations that can be understood by business users and is easier
        to monitor.
