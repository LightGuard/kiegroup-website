        OptaPlanner is an AI constraint solver. It optimizes planning and
        scheduling problems, such as the Vehicle Routing Problem,
        Employee Rostering, Maintenance Scheduling, Task Assignment, School
        Timetabling, Cloud Optimization, Conference Scheduling, Job Shop
        Scheduling, Bin Packing and many more. Every organization faces such
        challenges: assign a limited set of constrained resources (employees,
        assets, time and/or money) to provide products or services. OptaPlanner
        delivers more efficient plans, which reduce costs and improve service quality.
