        Kogito is designed from ground up to run at scale on cloud infrastructure.
        If you think about business automation think about the cloud as this is
        where your business logic lives these days. By taking advantage of the
        latest technologies (Quarkus, knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast
        boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

        Kogito adopts to your business domain rather than the other way around.
        No more leaking abstraction of the tool into your client applications.
        Stay focused on what the business is about instead of being concerned
        with technology behind it.
